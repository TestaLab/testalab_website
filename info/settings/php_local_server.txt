You need php installed in your machine.
After installing you can start a local php server for development.
In windows PHP needs to be in the "PATH" enviromental variables. 

To start the server, from a terminal:

cd \\storage.ad.scilifelab.se\TestaLab\Website\Website_v2_code
php -S localhost:8000

Then go to your browser and visit localhost:8000.
