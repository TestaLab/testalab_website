Now we use jdelivr to retrive npm packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is deprecated:

In order to update/add packages:
- install npm on your machine;
- from a terminal execute npm commands inside ./npm/ folder;

What was installed:

npm i bootstrap-icons
npm i img-comparison-slider
npm i bootstrap@next

We use bootstrap 5, at the time of making of the website this package was in beta.
So we need to use the @next tag to obtain the v5 over v4.
